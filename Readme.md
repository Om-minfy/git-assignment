## Git Assignment 1 - Basic Git Workflow

## 1. Repository with Commit History
    This repository contains a '.git' folder that preserves the full commit history from the initial commit through the final commit. The history includes four commits:
    a. Initial commit
    b. First commit with change in first line from Hii to Hello
    c. Second commit with change in second line from Om to Oms
    d. Final commit with change in third line from Raj to Rajs
